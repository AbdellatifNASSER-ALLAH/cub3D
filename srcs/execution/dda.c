** DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) Algorithm for Raycasting
** ============================================================
**
** The DDA algorithm is used to efficiently find where a ray intersects with
** walls in a grid-based map. It steps through the grid one square at a time,
** checking for wall collisions.
**
** Key Concept:
** Instead of checking every point along the ray, DDA jumps from grid line to
** grid line (either vertical or horizontal), always moving to the nearest
** intersection. This makes it very fast for grid-based raycasting.
**
** The algorithm works in steps:
** 1. Calculate ray direction based on player angle and screen position
** 2. Calculate delta distances (distance ray travels between grid lines)
** 3. Determine step direction (+1 or -1) and initial side distances
** 4. Loop: step to next grid intersection and check for walls
** 5. Stop when a wall is hit
**
** Variables explained:
** - rayDirX, rayDirY: Direction vector of the ray
** - mapX, mapY: Current grid square being checked
** - deltaDistX, deltaDistY: Distance ray travels to cross one grid square
** - sideDistX, sideDistY: Distance from current position to next grid line
** - stepX, stepY: Direction to step in grid (+1 or -1)
** - side: Which side of wall was hit (0 = vertical, 1 = horizontal)
*/

/*
** Initialize ray direction and starting map position
** 
** For each screen column (x), we cast a ray from the player's position.
** The ray angle is calculated by:
** 1. Starting from player's viewing angle
** 2. Subtracting half the FOV (to start at left edge of view)
** 3. Adding angle offset based on screen position (x)
**
** This creates a panoramic view where:
** - Left side of screen (x=0) -> rays point left of player's direction
** - Center of screen (x=WIDTH/2) -> rays point in player's direction  
** - Right side of screen (x=WIDTH) -> rays point right of player's direction
**
** We also calculate:
** - rayDirX, rayDirY: The direction vector (using cos/sin of angle)
** - mapX, mapY: Which grid square the player is currently in
** - px, py: Player's exact position in grid coordinates (not grid square)

/*
** Calculate delta distances
**
** Delta distances represent how far the ray must travel to cross one grid
** square in each direction (X and Y).
**
** Mathematical explanation:
** - If the ray moves 1 unit in X direction, it travels 1/rayDirX in total
** - We take absolute value because distance is always positive
** - If rayDir is 0 (ray is parallel to that axis), we use a very large
**   number (1e30) to represent "infinite" distance
**
** Example:
** - If rayDirX = 0.5 (ray at 30Â° angle), deltaDistX = 1/0.5 = 2.0
**   This means the ray travels 2 units to cross one grid square horizontally
** - If rayDirX = 1.0 (ray is horizontal), deltaDistX = 1.0
**   The ray travels exactly 1 unit to cross one grid square

/*
** Initialize step directions and initial side distances
**
** Step directions (stepX, stepY):
** - Determine which direction to move in the grid (+1 or -1)
** - Based on ray direction (positive or negative)
** - Example: if ray points right (rayDirX > 0), stepX = 1 (move right)
**
** Initial side distances (sideDistX, sideDistY):
** - Distance from player position to the FIRST grid line the ray will cross
** - Calculated differently based on ray direction:
**
** If ray points right (rayDirX > 0):
** - Need to reach the right edge of current grid square
** - Distance to edge: (mapX + 1.0 - px)
** - Total ray distance: (mapX + 1.0 - px) * deltaDistX
**
** If ray points left (rayDirX < 0):
** - Need to reach the left edge of current grid square  
** - Distance to edge: (px - mapX)
** - Total ray distance: (px - mapX) * deltaDistX
**
** Same logic applies for Y direction (up/down)
**
** These initial distances are crucial for the DDA loop to know where to
** start checking for walls.

/*
** Perform DDA algorithm - the main raycasting loop
**
** This is the core of the DDA algorithm. It steps through the grid square by
** square until it hits a wall.
**
** How it works:
** 1. Compare sideDistX and sideDistY to find which grid line is closer
** 2. Step to the closer grid line:
**    - If sideDistX < sideDistY: cross a vertical line
**      * Increase sideDistX by deltaDistX (move to next vertical line)
**      * Move to next grid square in X direction (mapX += stepX)
**      * Set side = 0 (vertical wall hit)
**    - Otherwise: cross a horizontal line
**      * Increase sideDistY by deltaDistY (move to next horizontal line)
**      * Move to next grid square in Y direction (mapY += stepY)
**      * Set side = 1 (horizontal wall hit)
** 3. Check if current grid square contains a wall ('1') or door ('D')
** 4. If wall found: mark as hit and store wall coordinates
** 5. If no wall: repeat from step 1
**
** Why this is efficient:
** - Only checks grid squares, not every point along the ray
** - Always moves to the nearest grid intersection
** - Guaranteed to find the first wall the ray hits
**
** The 'side' variable is important for rendering:
** - side = 0: ray hit a vertical wall (left/right face)
** - side = 1: ray hit a horizontal wall (top/bottom face)
** This is used later for texture mapping and shading.
