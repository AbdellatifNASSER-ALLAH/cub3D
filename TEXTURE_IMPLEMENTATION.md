# Texture Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds texture loading and rendering to the cub3D raycaster, with proper handling of wall sides and view-independent texture positioning.

## Changes Made

### 1. New File: `srcs/execution/texture.c`
- **load_texture()**: Loads XPM texture files using MLX's `mlx_xpm_file_to_image()`
- **load_textures()**: Loads all four wall textures (North, South, East, West)
- **get_texture_color()**: Samples texture color based on ray hit position and wall side

### 2. Modified: `srcs/main.c`
- Added `load_textures(game)` call in `init_game()` after MLX initialization
- Ensures textures are loaded before rendering begins

### 3. Modified: `srcs/execution/draw_vision.c`
- **draw_stripe()**: Updated to render textured walls instead of solid colors
  - Uses ceiling and floor RGB colors from config
  - Calculates texture coordinates independently of vertical camera movement
  - Ensures textures stay locked in place when looking up/down

### 4. Modified: `includes/cub3d.h`
- Added `load_textures()` function declaration

### 5. Modified: `Makefile`
- Added `texture.c` to source files list

### 6. Modified: `.gitignore`
- Added `libft/libft.a` to ignore build artifacts

## Technical Details

### Texture Mapping
The texture coordinates are calculated using:
```c
tex_y = (int)((y - wall_center + r->wall_height / 2) * step);
```

Where:
- `y` is the current screen pixel row
- `wall_center` is fixed at `HEIGHT / 2` (screen center)
- `r->wall_height` is the projected wall height
- `step` is the texture sampling step (`TEXTURE_HEIGHT / r->wall_height`)

This formula ensures that:
1. Textures are sampled correctly regardless of wall distance
2. Textures stay locked in place when the player looks up/down
3. Only the visible portion of the texture changes with vertical camera movement

### Wall Side Detection
The correct texture is selected based on ray direction:
- **side == 0** (vertical walls, X-axis collision):
  - `rayDirX > 0` → EAST texture
  - `rayDirX < 0` → WEST texture
- **side == 1** (horizontal walls, Y-axis collision):
  - `rayDirY > 0` → SOUTH texture
  - `rayDirY < 0` → NORTH texture

### Mouse Movement Handling
The implementation correctly handles mouse-based vertical camera movement:
- `player->z_eye` controls vertical viewing angle
- Changes to `z_eye` affect where walls are drawn (`r->start_y`, `r->end_y`)
- But texture coordinates are calculated relative to the fixed screen center
- Result: Textures appear stable, not shifting with vertical camera movement

## Testing Notes
The implementation has been compiled successfully and is ready for testing with:
```bash
./game maps/simple.cub
```

Expected behavior:
- Walls display their respective textures (North, South, East, West)
- Textures remain stable when looking up/down with mouse
- Ceiling and floor use colors from the .cub file configuration
- Textures are properly aligned and not distorted

## Configuration Format
The game expects a .cub file with texture paths:
```
NO ./textures/north.xpm
SO ./textures/south.xpm
WE ./textures/west.xpm
EA ./textures/east.xpm
F 220,100,0
C 225,30,0
```
