# cub3D

A simple, modular raycasting 3D engine using MiniLibX, inspired by Wolfenstein 3D.

## Features

- 3D rendering with wall textures (XPM format)
- Player movement and rotation (keyboard & mouse)
- Minimap display with field of view
- Configurable map and textures
- Designed for easy extension and experimentation

## File Structure

- **srcs/main.c**: Main game loop, rendering, and utility functions. Handles initialization, raycasting, drawing, and game logic.
- **srcs/execution/hooks.c**: Input handling (keyboard and mouse). Manages movement, rotation, and player controls.
- **srcs/player.c**: Player movement and rotation logic. Handles collision detection and movement calculations.
- **includes/cub3d.h**: Data structures, constants, and function prototypes. Defines the core architecture for the game state, player, textures, and configuration.
- **textures/**: Directory for wall textures (XPM format). Textures are mapped to North, South, East, and West walls.

## Key Functions

- `init_game`: Sets up the game, loads the map, player, and textures, and creates the window and image buffer.
- `draw_vision`: Main rendering loop. Casts a ray for each screen column, calculates wall hit, distance, and draws the 3D scene using textures.
- `dda_cast_ray`: Performs the DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) algorithm to find where a ray hits a wall.
- `get_wall_color`: Determines which texture column to use for the wall hit, based on the side and hit position.
- `draw_stripe`: Draws a vertical stripe for a wall, sampling the correct texture pixel for each y-coordinate.
- `move_player`: Applies movement and rotation to the player, with collision detection.
- `key_press`, `key_release`, `mouse_move`: Input event handlers for movement and camera control.

## Controls

- **W/A/S/D**: Move player
- **Arrow keys**: Rotate view
- **Mouse**: Look around
- **ESC**: Exit

## Textures

Place your wall textures in the `textures/` directory as XPM files.  
Textures are mapped to North, South, East, and West walls.  
To add new wall types, update the map parser and texture loading logic.

## Build & Run

```sh
make
./cub3D [map_file]
```

## Extending the Engine

This project is designed for learning and experimentation.  
To add new features (doors, pickups, enemies, new wall types):

- Extend the map parser and rendering logic to handle new symbols and textures.
- Add new functions for interaction and rendering, and update the game loop.
- Modify input handlers and player struct for new movement styles.
- Update rendering functions for effects like shading, fog, or lighting.

## Implementation Advice

- Start simple: Get basic raycasting and movement working before adding features.
- Keep functions modular: Each function should do one thing (e.g., raycasting, drawing, input).
- Use the data structures: The `t_game`, `t_player`, and `t_texture` structs are designed for easy expansion.
- Document your code: Add comments and update this README as you add features.
